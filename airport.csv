Small hot and very very smelly (the toilets are gross and are nearby everywhere you would sit because it'd so small). The upstairs area was much better but filled with smokers. If you can tolerate smoke I advise you to wait upstairs for your flight as it's much nicer. Still all of this would be OK and I would have forgiven it all (after all you are on a small island) but the security process was awful. There was one guy running the security line. He looked about 20 years old and was texting on his phone the whole time as people shoved their bags through and walked through the X-ray machine. He was not paying attention not to the bags going through the machine nor to the people walking through.",NA,NA,NA,2,5,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

The last couple of visits they have been forcing people to use the waiting area on the first floor. This is as dirty as the rest of the airport and is infested with flies. It is also too hot in warm weather as the new air-conditioners stopped working soon after they were installed. Do not use the toilets unless you take your own paper disinfectant and breathing apparatus. It is best to argue with the security people and hopefully get access to the downstairs waiting area.

Its noticeable how the efforts are trying to be made by Heathrow as a whole to try and improve its status (terminal 5 being a prime example) but there is still room for improvement. Interior looks very dated. Transaero seem to have their check-in zone tucked away from the main area so its a bit of a task trying to locate it. When we arrived there was an ominous-looking queue and we had noticed that the delayed take-off kept on getting extended every 5 minutes! Turned out that our plane was still in Moscow because of the weather so there was a 6-hour delay at most. We were given £25 to spend each in the airport though which explained the queue. Security was surprisingly swift very friendly staff. Giraffe restaurant very good not too expensive. Waiting seats are very hard comparable to park benches. Free Wi-Fi and good range of plug sockets. Something striking is the very long distances to walk to gates. It was a good 10 minute walk even with travelators! On return taxi to gate was very swift and we left the plane quickly. Immigration is in desperate need of a review in terms of services. Very long queues insufficient tables for filling out details (for some reason we weren't given them on the plane). Very grateful to the assistant who led us to the front because of the children (we had already waited 40 minutes). Unfriendly staff at immigration but on the other hand our baggage was all ready for collection and we were able to leave quickly from baggage reclaim.",NA,NA,NA,6,2,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

Eventually two people came along and proceeded to prioritise flights which were later than ones almost ready to depart the story goes on and on but the woman then proceeded to yell at me that I had 2 minutes or I would miss my flight.

Queues for Passport/Immigration have become ridiculous. Earlier this year the queues zig-zagged out of the arrivals hall and down the ramp. Thought this was a one off issue having used the airport many times previously and never experienced any real problems. Not so. It is now the norm. Took in excess of 1 hour 30 mins in queues on both occasions just to get to the Immigration/Passport desk. Once at the desk all formalities completed in a couple of minutes. The reason for the huge queues is that very few Immigration desks are manned. Officers are employed to look at the queues and then disappear only to emerge minutes later to do the same again. eparting was so much faster. A real breeze.

"miami-airport","/airport-reviews/miami-airport","Miami Airport customer review","Steve England","United Kingdom","2012-11-22","Flew into MIA today from Las Vegas. I'd previously sworn never to use this airport again after a nightmare transfer a few years ago. However I wanted to see the city and thought maybe it wouldn't be so bad if I was actually leaving the airport rather than just transferring. More so as it was a domestic flight so no immigration. WRONG!! The airport is poorly signed it is an incredibly long hike to baggage reclaim and by the time I got to the correct belt the carousel had stopped. On asking what had happened to the remaining baggage including mine a rude young lady merely said that it would be on the adjoining belt. I told her that I'd checked and the signs did not indicate the arriving flight from Las Vegas she told me to go to the baggage service desk which I had to find by myself. The staff there said that I should just go to my hotel and they would deliver my missing suitcase there. Not trusting MIA staff to do this I said I'd wait at the desk until they found it which they did surprisingly quickly. Two other passengers on my flight were at the desk with the same problem. The airport is poorly laid out long long walks past the gates to baggage reclaim rude uncaring staff and generally a total dump. The differences between MIA and McCarran Airport (Las Vegas) are stark McCarran being a very pleasant experience in contrast. MIA is by a mile the worst airport I've been to (and I've been to scores around the world). If you want to visit Miami try flying into Fort Lauderdale (not far from Miami).

Auckland is a good airport and is a breeze to use polite helpful staff and a large departure hall plentiful food outlets and you don't have to walk miles to get to your gate. You also don't get ambushed by staff trying to sell you things as you do at many American airports as you walk through duty free to reach your gate.

It's become a personal challenge to see how friendly and polite I can be and still get a surly response! This last trip I flew on Delta through Terminal Three which is showing its age with filthy worn carpet broken seats at the gates and broken fixtures in the bathrooms. The ticket counter agents were surly the TSA personnel were yelling at passengers the bartender at the Taverna restaurant was carding everybody including a surprised white haired old man in his seventies who proceeded to drop all his stuff on the floor while trying to find his ID and all the time the bartender was loudly slagging her managers. Wendy's had a long line that didn't seem to be moving the Delta/Sky West gate agent was curt to the point of rudeness and the flight was almost an hour late with no announcements. I should mention that in both Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 most of the shops and eateries close very early sometimes as early as 4:30 PM well before the evening flights leave. I can't count the number of times I've been stuck behind security with literally more than a thousand passengers who have no place to eat or drink. Sorry while all of that may be typical of the pathetic state of air travel in the USA these days none of it says ""friendly"" to me. To top it off the drunken-sounding automated announcer mangles names to the point of unintelligibility. On the return it is common to wait forty-five minutes or more for a checked bag.

"papeete-airport","/airport-reviews/papeete-airport","Papeete Airport customer review","Harun Rathore",NA,"2005-03-31","Arrived at and departed from PPT on a two-week Easter holiday. Some of the older comments are indeed true. Some need explanation. It is true that the immigration for non-FP and non-EU-nationals takes a while but it is nothing compared to the ordeals you sometimes have to go through when arriving in the USA. (I know what I am talking about. I had to cahnge in LAX before going to PPT.) The staff at PPT is overall very friendly – even at night – there is a little band to welcome you with traditional Tahitian music. The airport employees do not usually grunt the problem simply is the following: If you arrive at Tahiti and you do not understand French you are as lost as a person coming to the UK or the USA with little or no knowledge of English would be. However when you leave PPT to return back home  you have to pass ONE security control (screening of all your luggage and your body) before you can check in your luggage then you have to leave the security area for some reason no one was able to explain. You pass through a door and are once again in the airport’s main hall. You then have to go through passport control and have to go through ANOTHER security control where they screen your carry-on luggage and your body again. After that you arrive in the departure lounge. The latter can be crowded if two planes depart at the same time but there is one more public waiting room on the second floor and that was surprisingly empty. Very few passengers seemed to go there because the signs only read Airport Lounge. When it comes to boarding before you leave the terminal to walk out to your plane there is a THIRD security check. Security staff pick out some passengers to check them and their carry-on luggage by hand.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The airport has only two departure lounges where passengers seat like they are in school bus all facing in front.

The situation is worse when flights are delayed and it is normal to find more 500+ passengers in a lounge meant for not more than 200 people. Air-conditioning in the lounges does not work well and the TVs make so much noise that it is impossible to hear the announcements. The Duty Free shops are extortion points selling items for prices that are way above the normal price. Indeed there are renovations going on at the airport but the benefits are yet to be seen. A couple of years back customs officers used to connive with “helpers” (trolley pushers) and armed robbers and several passengers arriving in Accra had their items stolen.

The time it took from disembarking my CX flight to reaching the main concourse was over one hour due to being held up by baggage not coming out. I was particularly frustrated and anxious as I only had a 2 hour connection for a QF flight. As more people gathered around the belt by the time the luggage eventually came out it was chaotic and a matter of push and shove to collect bags. Problem was compounded with long immigration and security lines and 2 of the end counters for immigration were not in use which was very poor supervision by staff considering the situation. Once on the main concourse after 1.5 hrs whilst I couldn't get a thorough look around there weren't many Western food outlets and just lines of shops it really didn't offer much. Departures was just as bad and customs and immigration once again inefficient.

I have used LBA for departure twice recently with the new layout. At first the impression was a bit claustrophobic. I appreciated the new facilities. The idea of separate lounges (one for business one for leisure) is smart. I got a lot of work done on a 5 hrs delay and the £17 for 3 hours fare was well paid for. The small airport after the revamp has managed to squeeze in a lot of shops and cafes but still managed to preserve a small gathering area for each gate. The airport is obviously always busy and I can't imagine how it can be during peak holiday times. After security (pretty friendly and fast indeed) the hall is stretched to an almost single passageway. Getting a seat in the various cafes and fast-food places is a lottery.

It's a very confusing process, they just tell you: 'Sorry, we did not meet the deadline, but we will do our best to help you.'
          We can't do anything on the ground at Heathrow, so people have to pick up buses, buy a plane for the day and go in another part of the train. It's a really expensive process, as we have to do it in advance. As soon as we tell you the amount of time it takes, we have to tell them – sometimes we don't have someone on hand for more than 45 minutes. So we'll have to put our hand in hands.
          At Heathrow, an agent tells passengers, 'The first time we put on a tour agent, I was on a date with a London airport friend, and we went to Heathrow and tried to book a flight directly on to London Heathrow.

Check-in was straightforward and the North terminal wasn't crowded at all. There was ample space and it was very clean! Its also well sign-posted - I had to use the shuttle to get from the South to the North terminal and I haven't used Gatwick in a long time so was a little anxious about where everything was but turns out everything was dead simple to find! Security was security and staff weren't that friendly but I wasn't there for more than 5 minutes so no worries there. Departure lounge is a little disappointing as it didn't have as many shops and restaurants as I had anticipated but as an airport that offers mainly European routes you can't really expect it to be like Heathrow. Though saying that I think they are planning on adding more shops and restaurants. Departure gate took forever to appear on screen but once it was there it was a fairly short walk to it from the departure lounge and then after 10 mins at gate we were told to board the plane which was brilliant as I wanted to just sit back and relax. On the way back to Gatwick - passport queues were horrendous but they were moving steadily rather than being a complete stand still so was through in about half an hour. Overall very happy with the experience at Gatwick and would definitely recommend it! Wish it'd fly to more destinations outside Europe though as I'd much prefer it to Heathrow!",NA,NA,NA,8,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Both are very easy to use and get around with plenty of facilities and lounges to keep one busy should there be a flight delay (given how busy it gets there is potential for this to occur). In particular the food court in T2 (Virgin Blue Jetstar and regional NSW flights) has a great range of outlets with good views of planes moving around. For aircraft aficionados there are plenty of spots throughout this terminal for viewing planes taking off and landing. T3 is pleasant and is open throughout. It's easy to travel through yet doesn't have the same range of shops as T2. Staff are friendly and there is an interesting Qantas Heritage Museum located near Gate 14. Transfers between these terminals is easy through a subway that also goes to the railway station. T1 the international terminal has just been refurbished and is rather pleasant with a large range of shops to rival other airports worldwide. Going through customs etc. to leave the country is often a speedy process with queues minimal. However re-entering the country is a lot more difficult with queues for customs taking a while baggage taking its time to arrive on the carousel and immigration taking a while to screen everyone and their respective goods. I understand that they're trying to be scrupulous with who and what to allow in the country but surely there must be some way to speed up the process. A word of advice is to not arrive on a flight between 5am and 9am when most large long-haul aircraft arrive meaning particularly long queues for all arriving passengers. In general however it's an easy airport to use with all facilities that one could need.

I was charged $7.69 for what I thought was just over 1Euro. Apparently they tacked on a ""credit card"" fee without any notice. This reminded me about the awful experience I had flying out of CDG. First I was returning a rental car and all the way into the airport I was looking for where I needed to return the car. There were no signs. I continued into the airport and there were no signs to tell me where my airline was flying out of. My info from United was that it departed from Terminal Z. There is no terminal Z. I ended driving into the wrong Terminal (3) and found the location for the rental car return right next to the terminal. Unfortunately this was the wrong terminal for United. It was awful trying to find my way to the United terminal. I had to walk over 1/3 of a mile with my bags to get to a train. About 40 minutes after getting to the airport I finally got to Terminal 1. I'm glad I was 2.5 hours early otherwise I would have missed my flight. Fortunately getting through security was pretty quick.

Immigration/customs formalities are relatively efficient although it's still necessary to use the people mover (often crowded) to reach the immigration area. The ambiance and dining/shopping options vary by concourse. The United commuter concourse is the worst. The main C/D concourse (used by United for mailine flights) has gotten better over time. Departure security has gotten more efficient and there is now a second security area on the lower level near baggage claim along with the new security mezzanine. I recommend the lower level location as it is still lightly used. The new train system will connect to the smaller infield terminals before opening to the C/D. The opening of the train has been delayed but should occur early this year. Getting to the airport remains a hassle - the 5A bus to Rosslyn and L'Enfant Metro stations remains the cheapest option but is poorly promoted although information can be found on the DC Metro website. The buses to West Falls Church are the next best option; there used to be service to DC but it was not used enough to be profitable. Staying near Dulles means being carbound and having limited dining options. Service within the airport tends toward the indifferent.

I waited 20 mins at a customer service desk and was ignored.

If people were grateful for the fact they don't have to travel for hours before even reaching the airport then we wouldn't have a problem with the fee!

Unfortunately it is still an unremitting hell hole and is unworthy of a nation who say they regard tourism as important. Airport staff are officious unfriendly and downright rude the toilet facilities are appalling and dirty and every shop and stall treats its customer with utter contempt. The only food and drink available is of very poor quality and is priced at a level which would be a joke anywhere else. As an example I paid 4 pounds sterling for a cheese sandwich that had been made the previous day according to the label and was packed in a non-airtight card box. Consequently the bread was dry stale and inedible. I drew the line at paying £3.70 for a Kit Kat and left this at the till. This airport takes a very cynical view of its customers and makes no attempt to provide any form of customer service. Instead it wastes no opportunity to rip off the captive market in a way that I have never seen at any other airport (and I have seen quite a few).

Arrivals was quick. (I recommend getting your visa prior to arriving in ADD as the visa application process does take a while) Clearing immigration and getting your passport stamp took no longer than 3 minutes. Bags took about 20 minutes to arrive and came out sporadically but all came safely and thats all that matters. Ethiopian customs x-rays all luggage prior to exiting so that took some time as well but you are dealt with in a professional and polite manner. As for departures your tickets and passports are checked prior to entering the terminal building and there is an x-ray and metal detector immediately upon entering. Check-in was efficient USA departures have their own area where you are asked the typical security questions. Your passports/visas are heavily scrutinized (presumably because of the large amount of fraudulent documents that make their way through ADD and airlines getting charged large fines for transporting these people.) Passing through immigration is a simple exit stamp and you proceed upstairs where there is a fair amount of duty free shops and eateries. There is another security check to enter the specific gate area (and might I add the metal detector in the gate is extremely sensitive).

Once inside met by airport employees giving out tourist booklets. Some waiting for luggage but nothing too bad. Out through customs slightly cramped and signage could be better. Signs to the train steers you towards the airport train which is the same as S-Bahn but costs much more: make sure you go for the S-Bahn it is very easy to miss. Departure: if you arrive by train (whether S-Bahn or CAT) you have to go through the arrivals area and a narrow corridor to find an elevator to departures: suboptimal. But the worst part was that our flight to Oslo was not on the screens! It turned out that low-cost carriers have a separate check-in building across the road from the main terminal. Though HG flights which also have to be checked in in that building are on the screens. There is basically no information on that: very bad. Once we found the check-in desk and dropped the luggage (which went reasonably fast) the rest was OK. Security is at the gate so you go first to a very decent selection of shops and cafes. The ground-floor boarding area (the bus-gates) is shambolic though lots of flights with probably three security channels and while the security people were doing their best there was some queuing. Once in it's very packed and there is a pretty useless shop wedged in between the gates so there were two chaotic queues trying to get through some very narrow space.

My flight from HYD had the misfortune of being parked at a remote stand which meant wasting 20 minutes on a bus back to the terminal.

Then came the bizarre process of going down a set of escalators walking 50 feet then up another escalators to the floor we were just on this time a little further down the hall. Then came the hike from the far end of Concourse 2 to the transfer desk for BA at the other end of Concourse 1. What's maddening is that the transfer desks are outside security by just a few feet (amazingly to reach them you are told to go the wrong way through the metal detectors) so after getting my boarding pass I had to go through security again even though I'd just been in a secured area! Finally boarding pass in hand I could head for my gate - only to find yet another useless security check! The whole thing took exactly one hour while speed walking through the terminal enduring 3 security checks during that time 2 of which were unnecessary. At least with the exception of one officer at the third and final security check the personnel I encountered were helpful and efficient. The bottom line after two transits through Dubai - if your arriving flight parks at an aerobridge the process isn't bad taking perhaps 30 minutes though you may have to walk a bit.

My experience flying in and out was very pleasant – RIC is a “human sized” airport so it is easy to get around. Baggage recovery was fast and painless with our checked bags appearing only about five minutes after we had arrived at the carousel. The rental car desks are conveniently sited and the rental car garage is a two minute walk from the terminal. Our total time from landing to driving off in a rental car was less than thirty minutes. The airport is well connected to the adjacent Interstate highway so the airport is easy to get into and out of. On departure check-in and security was quick and painless. There is a restaurant in the secure area offering a view of the ramp a pleasant thing for the travelling aircraft buff.

GRU is the worst IMHO. The baggage claim area has go to be one of the worst-configured I've seen: little space between baggage carousels and that made worse by the fact that baggage carts (at least they're free) are stacked between the carousels. When crowds jam around a carousel after a large plane arrives chaos can ensue. If it's a hot day the lack of effective air conditioning makes things worse (what this will be like during the World Cup I don't know). After Customs we stood in a long line to check our bags for a connecting domestic flight. Then went upstairs through security (that was quick) and downstairs to a crowded departure gate serving two flights. Passengers were told to get on one of two buses depending on their destination. Then we all went to exactly the same remote terminal and waited again for our flights (at least there was air conditioning here).

The staff are rude, impolite and arrogant. They seem to go out of their way to avoid eye contact and therefore having to respond to any questions. We arrived with what we thought was ample time to make a connection. Once we had our bags we proceeded to the connecting airline bag drop. We had already checked in on line. This turned out to be of no value time wise. The woman at the bag drop sat and chatted with a colleague while the queue grew. She did nothing. When she finally opened up her desk we had lost half an hour. She told us we were over weight on one bag. It had been underweight on the flight we had just come in on. We took out one jacked which made the difference. Then she told us we had to hurry, our departure gate was about to close. We rushed to our departure gate only to find our flight was actually delayed for an hour. When that gate opened, there were two people at two check in desks. These two chatted and laughed with a third who subsequently left. They carried on with their conversation while the crowd grew and fumed. There was no order, no lines. The guy, officious at best, started to take the 'fast track' passengers first. This took about 20 minutes before they began to accept the rest of the passengers. At the moment I am at Heathrow. This is a model of efficiency, orderly with staff who are helpful. Heightens the contrast of the Rome airport experience.

Arrival was quick and I was through immigration customs et al. within half an hour. Limited exchange facilities--one bank with several locations and exchange rates that are slightly less favorable than intown. Getting to the Pavaletsky-bound train means going into the domestic terminal a lengthy walk with many signs although a couple are a little confusing as to direction. The train leaves every 30 or 60 minutes depending on time of day. On New Years (a big holiday in Russia) it was running to Pavaletsky but not to the airports. For departure I arrived early (3+ hours) because it was a holiday (New Years) and new procedures were rumored to be in place for US flights (turned out not to be the case). The train from Pavaletsky was not running in the am - taxi was R1500 (after an initial ""offer"" of R2000) - a hair-raising but uneventful ride. Note that the limited food/shopping options and non-existent seating on the ground floor of the departure terminal are just part of the story--seating and food/shopping are on the second floor. Passport control and security screening were uneventful and reasonably efficient. The departure areas are filled with upscale stores and the usual duty free stuff. Expect to pay 50-100% more for food and drink than you would in the city. Most airports seem to have stopped this kind of nonsense.

Firstly the wait at the BA check in was about an hour with only 3 desks open higher classes of travel had their own check in desks and the staff there were largely unemployed. Heathrow took five minutes. The wait to go through security was about 40 minutes there was only one desk with one officer and three belts Heathrow has approximately twenty belts and a myriad of security officers and again took five minutes. Another officer did come to help the one on her own but all too late and it looked very inefficient indeed it was also unsafe and I saw a large bottle of water go through on someone's hand baggage that went unchallenged. Signage was also inaccurate telling you to remove your shoes and belt but nothing about wallets pockets etc therefore time was wasted in operatives repeatedly having to get customers to rectify their mistakes they were also rude and overbearing in their manner.

The airport is OK but could be a whole lot better. The usual temptation for airports to prioritise income from rents over the smooth movement of passengers has prevailed. Many of the corridors in the satellite terminal have become narrow passageways because shops have been plonked in the middle of them. I'm sure the designers didn't intend it this way and it really grates on me that space and convenience for the users is sacrificed at the altar of the almighty ringgit. Add to this the propensity for people to shuffle three abreast in these narrow spaces and you have a number of unnecessary choke points. F&B outlets are plentiful but expensive and the airline lounges are generally pretty average. There are few places to sit in the terminal unless you're spending money (by design?) and the sanitation in the restrooms is not great although miles ahead of the disgraceful LCCT (thankfully now superseded by KLIA2) Taxi services like elsewhere in Malaysia are terrible and the access roads in the arrivals and departure areas are chaos with double parking in no standing zones the norm.

Queues everywhere and departure lounge in particular was bursting with people. There was vastly inadequate seating and not even enough floor space for tired passengers to sit on without causing an obstruction to others. I couldn't believe how many more passengers were allowed to pour in when there was clearly inadequate room for existing passengers due to flight delayed caused by weather. When passengers were finally called to gates they were left standing for a good 30 minutes before a member of staff began to process the enormous queue that had built up. Our gate number was changed at the last minute and it took ages to work our way through the crowds to join the long queue. Once through the gate we waited an equally long period of time queuing for the airport bus on the hot stairwell. My overall opinion is that this airport does not have the capacity to cope with the volume of people coming through at peak periods. Even taking into account the delays due to weather I struggle to see how this airport has enough seats public toilets (no toilet paper in any of ladies toilets) food and drink areas for the numbers passing through.

I have generally found queues short and staff helpful. However my most recent experience was rather less than perfect because KLM has introduced some very short transit times. Going out was 55 minutes and on return 40 minutes. The first was just doable but the second very stressful and I only made my flight by jumping a queue (on instruction from staff) and running the last part (I was not alone). The problem is exacerbated if you are on short-haul Cityhopper flights which park away from the terminal and require a bus to and from them this reduces the transit time by at least 10 minutes. On the second occasion my second flight was 'now boarding' as I got off the bus from the first flight and 'gate closing' appeared when I was still some minutes from having my boarding card checked and going through security. This was despite going straight to the gate at a brisk walk anyone unfamiliar with the airport or unable to keep up a good pace would really struggle. In the end Schiphol worked but I found the experience unnerving and I caution transit passengers with less than hour between flights to be ready for a stressful experience.",NA,NA,NA,6,4,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

Flying into the airport isn't too bad although the pick-up point for arrivals is now as big a shambles as the drop off zone for departing passengers. Departures is a different story. Apart from the scrum at the aforementioned drop off point the check in desks are partitioned off from the rest of the departure hall and you're not allowed to proceed to check in until instructed to do so. Fair enough but the amount of seating in the departure hall is completely inadequate for the number of passengers waiting for their check in desk to open. Also there is only one channel through the partition and when check in for a particular flight opens this is immediately mobbed by the waiting passengers with no attempt by the authorities at managing the process or – heaven forbid – organizing a queue. Once airside things do improve but since passengers have already gone through full security screening at a) entry to the departure hall and b) entry to the check in area why is there a need for a third security check at the gate itself?

"atlanta-hartsfield-airport","/airport-reviews/atlanta-hartsfield-airport","Atlanta Hartsfield Airport customer review","Rich Jenkins","United States","2010-01-08","ATL's major function is providing domestic connections for Delta passengers and it does this fairly well with an efficient train system between concourses. OTOH the concourses are long and Delta customer service (such as it is) has been greatly cut back. Earlier this year I encountered a situation where the wrong type of aircraft had been provided (after a long delay and cancellation of flights before and after ours) and the ticket staff were less than gracious in dealing with the fallout. The food selection remains relatively unhealthy and the largest food court (outside of the main terminal) tends to be crowded. The selection of reading material is generally pretty awful but typical of Atlanta in general. CNN is loud and inescapable and the airport generally provides even less opportunity for peace and quiet than the average. Departure security is centralized and unpredictable but not quite as timeconsuming as it was 2-3 years ago. The ""secret"" North terminal alternative to the main terminal security has been closed--this had provided much faster screening because it was known only to people using the T terminal and carriers other than Delta. Baggage areas have been remodeled but there no longer is security to check tags. Beware of taxi operators who approach you in the baggage claim as they charge more than the ones in the queue outside. Expect taxi drivers to not know anything other than major hotels - bring mapquest-type directions to your destination. Long time Atlantans don't know much of the area either. Marta rapid transit service has gotten slightly better although the process of paying for fares with cards is cumbersome compared with the old token system. Marta is the best way to reach major hotels downtown in Midtown and Buckhead. Customer service is generally horrible in the airport although better with carriers other than Delta. Despite many years of living in ATL and much international travel I always cleared customs elsewhere (my int'l travel was mostly to Asia and on United so ATL was rarely feasible) my understanding is that international arrivals are variable and often unpleasant. The international terminal which used to be dismal is apparently being redone. Delays are common at this airport - the weather in the Atlanta area is volatile with downpours and thunder storms being quite common in Spring and summer plus Atlanta gets the back end of hurricanes in the fall. Often things will seem mild or only drizzly at the airport but will be violent somewhere in an nearby flight path and this will cause delays. Some delays occur because of problems elsewhere in an airline's hub/spoke system and this is particularly true of Delta which dominates the airport. Morning departures are more predictable and less prone to delay than afternoon or evening flights.",NA,NA,NA,2,3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

However in recent years it has been taken over by a company determined to squeeze every last penny out of customers. The drop-off area costs £2 simply to enter so many people simply take a chance and drop passengers off on the mini-roundabouts. There is no taxi rank so taxis bringing passengers to the airport cannot get a fare back to the city. The airport taxis are provided by Arrow cabs which are more expensive than local firms (for example £20 to my home instead of the local firm's fare of £10). If you live locally and are flying home take the number of a local cab firm with you and call them when you leave the plane. The taxi will be waiting for you when you exit the airport. Public transport is poor; there is no train service and the many flights arrive or leave outside the hours of the bus services. The terminal is cramped so it can be difficult for example to get through to the lavatories if you are carrying hand luggage.

Signage from the garage to the US Air arrivals area in the terminal was similarly unedifying; I had to ask an employee for directions. Same thing to navigate the return to the garage. The signage for the terminals and parking is not only confusing but also dangerous: any attempt to change lanes runs the risk of involving oneself in a crash with one of the numerous fast-approaching vehicles on one's tail.

Terminal 3 is old but some money has been spent to renovate the terminal. It is a long walk from the gate to the immigration check but there was no queue for European passport holders. Even for foreigners the queue was moving pretty fast. It took me less than 15 minutes from landing to immigration check which was impressive. Then I went to pick up my luggage and surprisingly they were waiting on the belt. It was a total 20 minutes from the time I landed to the time I got on Heathrow Express.

When I get to one of the many restaurants did the experience improve. Here service was fast and efficient. A visit to one of the many toilet showed them to be fairly well kept and in good working order.

I was in a rush after my friend was stopped and questioned by British immigration officials and we lost some time. In that rush the layout was a bit confusing. The planes park close to the building so even without the ramp/tunnel to the aircraft, boarding the plane is no hassle - unless it was pouring down rain.

I read the criticisms of both and find that while I agree with some of the things that are said about them both when it comes to choice I would always prefer Liverpool over Manchester because Liverpool is smaller and less crowded. I agree that it is looking tatty around the edges and that the management seems to be doing all it can to encourage spending even removing most of the seats near gates 12 and 3 where we used to wait happily away from all the commercial outlets for our flight to be called. However it has a big airy security area where we have never encountered any long queues whereas we have found security at Manchester both congested and claustrophobic. It has rarely taken us more than 30 minutes from one of the on site car parks to the departure lounge on our outward journey while on our most recent return journey we landed at 23.30 and exited from the car park at 23.50. At Manchester one is lucky to complete the same process in an hour unless you pay over the odds for the closest car parks. Travelling hand luggage only means that as long as Liverpool continues to provide quick transit and absence of major queues my wife and I will go on making it our preferred airport.",NA,NA,NA,7,4,3,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,1

Customs was also pretty straightforward and in no time at all we were through and on our way into Singapore CBD. Departures were again very very efficient with fast check in and immigration. Terminal 3 was very clean and modern with lots of duty free shops and we also visited Terminal 2 (looking a bit dated) to see the M&Ms Concept Store.

Now the new overflow security channels are open which issue forth to the old terminal area - so if you want to use the facilities in the main terminal its a 10 minute walk and don't even think about buying the fast track ticket for security (which went up 25% from £3 to £4 last week) as you will be turned away if they are sending you to the overflow security channels.

The security check is done by a team at each of the gates prior to boarding. When the start of the security check was announced we stood in a long line and had no opportunity to prepare ourselves by emptying pockets removing jackets taking out computers etc. People standing in line finally came to the single checkpoint where a woman barked out orders like a drill sergeant to move on through quickly. The people operating the full body scanner were competent and professional. Once we had passed through security we assumed that boarding the airplane was to begin shortly. Instead we were kept for 2 hours. in an overcrowded holding pen that seemed to have been designed for cattle. The holding pen had no toilets and a single machine for selling water. I lost 3 euros in it without a bottle coming out and when I asked the KLM agent nearby she replied brusquely (without looking up) that the airline had nothing to do with the machine. A short time later I saw a Dutch gentleman go through the same procedure. I walked over to the counter where he spoke to the same KLM employee. He said that he had lost his money in the machine and asked if he could exchange a 5 euro bill for coins so that he could try again. The agent dismissed him saying ""I am not a bank!"". He was told a place in the airport where he could report the problem but came back later saying that they could not help him there. I elected not to go with him because I was informed that I would have to go through the entire security routine again and that we would be getting water on the airplane. Later on in the airplane the captain apologized for the long delay explaining that it was due to the fact that the airplane had arrived late from its previous flight. Obviously the security people knew this so it was puzzling why they rushed us through so quickly knowing that we would have to stand in the holding pen for hours before being able to board the airplane.",NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

The new international concourse is very impressive. However I do think it could be utilized a little bit more but it is a busy airport during the rush hours of 10am to 5pm. Some problems is that the AC does not work that well in Immigrations or Customs but that will soon be changed as they are building a whole new section to replace the current immigration and customs area. There are so many shops and a new shopping concourse is suppose to open really soon. I think there should be a first class lounge for all the airlines that don’t have their own and I feel the check in lobby in the departure concourse needs to be extended. During the busy periods its way to crowded and it seems like it takes forever for you to check in. Also I think they need to raise the roof in the western concourse it’s a little bit to low and it feels claustrophobic. If you’re an aviation fan this is a nice airport to for some spotting from the East concourse because it’s very airy and allot of glass windows. Overall I give the airport 4 out of 5.

"brussels-charleroi-airport","/airport-reviews/brussels-charleroi-airport","Brussels Charleroi Airport customer review","Giannicola Bonora","Italy","2013-12-20","Relatively new and shining clean due to the generous use of stainless steel. Epitome for the low-cost airport of the XXI century: Extra long and narrow tarmac to avoid using buses or skyways. Where the similarly long and narrow building can't reach there are long covered walkways airside. Be prepared for possible long walks both on arriving and departing. This is an airport that depends on Ryanair so you can't expect any pity. Asking for a boarding pass (a minimalist slip of paper) for a checked in flight costs 70 euros no matter what. There are two ATM machines in the hall one near the arrivals one at the opposite corner of the building (on the left exiting from airside). Exiting at this same corner you can reach the bus station where you can buy a ticket for Charleroi South Station from the machines (coins notes cards accepted). The bus station is not covered and Charleroi is a very rainy place but lucky enough you get the bus from platform A which is the nearest to the terminal. On departing I was puzzled by the double way in at security apparently doing the same things but working alternatively. Security fast and professional. Duty free looks good but I had no time to spend. After stepping to the gates you are in no- man land: long minimalist bleaky corridors where the stainless steel only adds up to the coldness of the environment. There's a bakery stand before the last hop to the tarmac. In winter I suggest buying a hot drink. The low cost travel industry states that if passengers have to wait they have to do it as close as possible to the aircraft they are boarding and in this airport this means in the open air though under a covered walkway.",NA,NA,NA,7,4,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

In some respects it has improved in the intervening period eg. more space in the departure lounge but in others it remains the same eg. rip-off prices for refreshments. Arrival was easy particularly since we were on hand luggage only and there were few other flights at that time. Departure seemed smooth enough too until the delay became apparent. We acted on the advice of previous correspondents and entered through Arrivals but in any case the check-in area was not too crowded. Seeing that the departure lounge had plenty of empty seats we went swiftly to security (short queues) and were through quite quickly. Our online paper boarding ""cards"" did seem to be a cause of some surprise though. We were quite impressed by the security staff who were both pleasant and efficient. I forgot to extract my liquids bag from my hand luggage: it was spotted on the scanner I was asked politely to open my bag and after the contents were inspected I was thanked. On our second passage through having had to go back to the landside restaurant for our free ""light refreshments"" the pencils my wife invariably carries in the top of her socks were spotted and investigated: no one else has ever noticed them on any of our trips abroad. The departure lounge did become crowded at times announcements were hard to hear - partly because of the combined noise of several hundred people but also because of the speed at which many of them were made - and the screens were less than informative or up-to-date. There seemed to be long queues at the food counter and if the prices we saw as we had our free refreshments in the restaurant were any indication the airport must be making a mint (each free pie + bottle of water would have cost 5 euros with a 1.50 euro cover charge on top). Predictably enough our spare unopened bottle of water handed out in the restaurant upstairs then had to be surrendered at security downstairs but the security lady was charming about it. When we returned to the departure lounge after our refreshments it was much quieter and there was room to spread out for the rest of our wait though the metal seats are scarcely comfortable. Also why are they in threes when so many passengers are in couples? Overall a mixture of pluses and minuses but I would give it 3 stars rather than 2 because of the surprisingly positive impression we gained of the security staff.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

On the return flight we taxied to a remote stand and were bussed to a gate close to terminal 1. Long layover of 6.5 hours. While deciding what to do I was approached by a friendly airport employee who explained my options including (as a UK passport holder) the option to pass through immigration and leave the airport if I so wished. In the end decided to find somewhere quiet to try and catch up with my sleep. Rather than proceed to my departure gate I went up the elevator to the arrivals floor and walked back towards terminal 3. Limited seating en-route and no facilities other than toilets but very quiet and I was largely undisturbed for several hours. I noticed a room full of seating close to the transfer desk. Approaching departure time I made my way back to the departures level and through security (peculiarly I don't remember needing to do this on the outward leg).

It seems that the airport management did not make any attempt to deal with the extra amount of visitors during this busy season. Domestic departures are a joke. They run 3 security gates but for the economy class passengers there they only open 2 the third is reserved for business class and 'priority' passengers. As a result the queues are so big that there is no way that the departures hall can cope - especially with no effort to organise a queue instead allowing passengers into a free-for-all scrum. Given that possibly 10% of passengers are business class or 'priority' this flaw in security gate allocations mean that 90& of passengers are squeezed into only 66% of the gates. If there was the slightest bit of common sense among the security staff then they would filter economy class passengers through the business/priority gate to ease the strain on the overly-busy economy gates. It makes no sense for a third of the security gates (and therefore a third of the security staff) to stand there doing nothing whilst the other two gates are bursting at the seams. Even when passengers who were rushing for their flights were allowed through they were forced to jump the queue of the gate relevant to their ticket therefore skipping the economy class queue. I would suggest a through review of security procedures especially considering the staff were more confused by my Vietnamese residence card (which is helpfully translated into Vietnamese) than my English passport - something I would have hoped to speed up the process! The departures hall is bearable with just about enough seats. Thankfully the domestic terminal is moderately priced for food and drink if you are a foreign/expat traveller but I suspect on the expensive side for local travellers.",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Overall it appears as though some improvements have been made although still more needs to be done to raise the standard of Terminal 1 to anywhere near that of most other airports in the region. This being a late Wednesday morning departure it was not overly crowded. On arrival into the building there was a standard security check quite normal. Although there were monitors indicating the departure gates we found no information on the specific location of airline counters within the check-in area. Eventually after some searching we found ours. Although we arrived at the terminal relatively late (two hours before departure) the line wasn't long and with four desks open the check-in procedure took no more than 15 minutes including waiting time. Immigration cards were completed after which we proceeded to pay the user charge 750 pesos per person (USD 17.50 would also have been accepted) with a five minute wait in line. Passport control was next; this entailed the longest queue roughly 20 minutes. Immediately thereafter was the aviation security check only a minute and we were through. A brief stop at the washroom which was acceptable although slightly crowded. Finally a 6-7 minute walk to Gate 3; considering other reviews regarding Terminal 1 waiting areas we were pleasantly surprised as it seemed relatively recently refurbished. The only complaint we might have would be the acoustics which left somewhat to be desired. It was difficult to hear the many announcements with all the chatting among our fellow passengers. The entire terminal was overall clean and in reasonably good shape considering its age. On our return ten days later we arrived in Terminal 1 late on a Sunday morning just after several wide-body long- haul flights from Europe and the Middle East. Understandably the immigration lines were long but the supervisor was very flexible and opened the diplomatic line also for ordinary travellers. After twenty minutes we came to the baggage belts which were overloaded; in fact there were so many other flights listed on the baggage board that there was no room for ours. Nevertheless after asking the staff nearby we found our baggage belt and within ten minutes our party had received all four checked bags. The customs line was rather long since not all workstations were manned; the wait was around fifteen minutes.

But it has slipped in a couple of areas of late. The first impression if you use Long Term Car Park 1 is the bus to the terminals. This used to be for car park passengers only and it stopped at both terminals. Now it is for car park passenger 'set down' passengers using the free 15 minute option and airport staff. As a result it is slow and meanders its way through the car park before stopping at a point which still requires an open air walk to reach Terminal 2 departures. Quite why business travellers should be forced to share a bus with airport ramp workers is beyond me - no other airport mixes staff and passenger buses. The 'priority channel' at security causes resentment from passengers queuing in the 'normal' access - particularly when only 2 out of 5 checking lanes are available. Servisair lounge offers very little in the way of comfort food or beverages and the thumping music from the Tie Rack shop nearby is intrusive. On return the automatic passport readers are a plus - but then it all goes wrong again with the latest change to car parking. You can no longer pay in the terminal; instead you have to drive to the exit gate park pay in a draughty shed with only 2 machines (which do not have clear instructions for use) then back out into the oncoming traffic to drive to the exit lanes.

There are no shops on the domestic airside. The business lounge is almost always closed. And the local airline Air Astana does not provide this service for domestic flights. There is a small restaurant in the old and new part. There are shops in the international airside. There is a small restaurant/bar. The business lounge is available and open 24 hours. Use of this service is based on the airline. Lufthansa gets a limited menu of drinks and food. KLM seems to be more generous (no apparent restrictions). But it is an old room with plastic leather seating and not much else. There are enough ATM´s available to get cash. There are no newspapers/magazines for foreigners. Only taxis ordered or outside at the official taxi stand have decent fares. But agree on a fixed price no meters installed. Ignore offers inside the building.

There was massive check-in confusion amongst passengers and staff with no attempt by airport staff to inform us as to what was happening.

For arrivals the immigration queues can be very slow sometimes especially when several international flights arrive together and the meet and greet area is always just chaotic. The other terminals (2 and 3) are much more built for purpose and are more cheery.

Once you have a rough idea the signage (or lack of it) will not be so confusing. However because I was transferring between airlines I could not arrange for the automatic transfer of my bags at Frankfurt so had to collect them on arrival and re-check them for the next sector: to do this you have to pass through immigration so any passenger in transit between airlines will need either a EU passport or a visa in order to collect hold baggage. Maybe I was dumb but nowhere could I see a Transfer Desk as at other airports where a transfer could be carried out. Also if in transit between terminals using the overhead train be warned that you have to pass through security: as another poster has noted they use hand wands set to the most sensitive setting: watches all small change shoes belts pens etc have to be removed; even the passport in my shirt pocket had to be taken out and inspected.

As proud Canadian citizens, we passed through the immigration quickly even though we had to declare some chocolate that we bought from Tokyo International airport. All our checked luggages came in the carousel within half a minute. I was completely amazed by the efficiency of Vancouver airport! We arrived on Canada day, so there were Canada pins put out for people to take, and the statues were excellent. We had a bit of a hard time finding the car rental place though, and the staff in the airport were helpful yet some were expressionless. When we arrived again in YVR from YYJ, our luggage was the only one so we got it as soon as we got there. And departing YVR was great as well. We checked in for the United Airlines flight to San Francisco, and since we took Business Class we had Priority check in, which saved a whole load of time as the Economy queue was huge. The US border security was fast and really smooth (we were on Business Class tickets and we cannot find the Business lane so we queued in the Economy lane), and the security personnel were extremely friendly opposed to the army like situation in SFO when exiting the US. I highly recommend this airport and I could not have asked for a better experience in YVR.","Arrival and Departure","28-07-2015","FamilyLeisure",10,5,5,5,NA,0,5,5,NA,1

The TSA officials are very efficient and courteous and the Aerotrain is also very convenient as well. Coming back is another story even though Dulles has improved. First of all are the ancient plane mates which take you to the international arrivals building but which will be used for the foreseeable future. Second even though the electronic kiosks for U.S. citizens in theory are a good idea they are complicated to use at first and you still have to hand the print out to a border security agent. Third the border security agents are extremely rude even to U.S. citizens. The agent who looked at my passport asked me where I visited which I told him and then he began grill me about why I didn't mention the other country I visited (Turkey where I only changed flights) even though I never left the airport to get my connecting flight! Fourth your luggage is routinely removed from the baggage carousel and placed in a pile without you even knowing. I made a complaint to Dulles Airport's Twitter handle and was told that the airlines are doing this and not the airport but that they would look into it. Even with all these complications on my return it only took me about an hour to be out of the airport. If only Dulles could improve the return experience for international passengers it would truly be a great airport.",NA,NA,NA,8,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

On arrival a very slow queue to get visas. I could not understand why it takes so long to take money and put a stamp in your passport. Then the even longer and slower queue at passport control. One reason they are slow at this point is that the available cubicles are never fully manned. Onto luggage claim - at the opposite end of the airport to the aircraft. You need a 1 Lira coin for a trolley. If you do not know this or do not have one you are stuck. I learnt the hard way during a previous trip.

Ryanair  who base 6 737-800`s here use the area directly in front of the terminal. Passport/Border control can be busy and crowded if more than one aircraft in-especially for UK passengers. Luggage collection hall is large with six carousels but again can get very busy as the Ryanair flights go out together in the morning and return at a similar time at 4-5 hour intervals during the day with final flights about 22.30.Other charter flights are spread out throughout the day and night with  as has been traditional for many years at holiday destinations - a ""German day""  a ""British day"" a ""Dutch day"" etc.No Customs as such  just out through the doors to a full length and narrow area where Holiday and Car Hire reps. await. Coaches and a car park is straight opposite and since Ryanair arrived there has been a substantial investment by the airport including a new multi storey car park access roads and a new filling station/car hire area. The whole arrival system generally seems to work quite well . Departures- Check in is generally a nightmare the area is far too small for the numbers and Ryanair will not start check in until 2 hours before departure leaving queues of 150+ sometimes snaking out of the entrance doors (and in amongst the smokers). This problem is made worse by passengers repacking luggage at the front of the line to save paying excess.It is also exasperated by the charter companies dropping off their clients 3 hours before making the whole area very busy.There is a large cafe/bar which is again very busy. Once checked in it gets much better and you pass upstairs  through very strict security and scanning to the large and airy departure lounge with views of most of the airfield. Two decent sensibly priced snack restaurantst hree large shops and loads of seating including an open area with bar at high season.

However my gripe is directed at the 4 'officers' who were situated in the booth next to the one in use who were deep in discussion. If this was training It should have been done out of sight of travelling passengers or could a sign not be used to inform passengers that they are training and not just gossiping because that's what it looked like. Lots of staff around the full airport but I don't think they were all being used to their full potential and some not the most pleasant.

This time around I was disappointed. Firstly, the security check. If you've forgotten a small plastic bag for your carry on liquid items you are encouraged to pay out £1 for a bag - don't bother doing this! Once through there were staff handing them out for free. Not sure why they do this, Heathrow and most other airports seem to give the bags out for free. The security check itself was awful. The queue was unbelievable and crawled along at a snails pace. The low ceilinged queuing area was stiflingly hot and the whole thing was just bad. Compare this to my last flight from Heathrow when I zipped through in 10 mins, max. Once through, the facilities on offer aren't too bad, but the terminal building felt very dingy and closed off, there were no windows that offered views out onto the runway area. I'm sure there were last time I flew from here. The walk from the terminal building to the boarding gate for my flight was also epic. Admittedly, that isn't necessarily a problem unique to Bristol. Coming back, again the walk to immigration and baggage reclaim was a real epic, worse than going out. That said, bags came off quickly and the joy of a small airport is that you're out and on your way pretty quick. I've been told that Bristol is undergoing a bit of an upgrade, so be to be fair some of my gripes may be resolved in the future. If you're flying this summer though, prepare for some long and sweaty queuing at security.","Arrival and Departure","13-06-2015","FamilyLeisure",4,1,3,3,NA,3,1,0,NA,1

Passing through a few days ago the queue for departures security checking had over 100 passengers waiting and stretched outside the terminal to the ""arrivals"" taxi queue! ""Upgrading"" the security area is currently causing regular 40/50 minute delays-after check-in. Airside insufficient seating had passengers standing and blocking walk ways whilst awaiting their flight departures-and this was mid-afternoon in November as opposed to a peak high season departure time. The arrival of Ryanair and the proposed January arrival of Easyjet (from BFS-Belfast International) has added to the considerable strain this facility was under over 3 years ago yet there are no signs of the expansion of passenger facilities. The ""passenger collection point"" was once a tin cabin in a far off point in the car park has dissapeared and has been replaced with an open plastic covered ""wind tunnel"". Add to this the proposed extension of the single runway to accept bigger longer range aircraft and total chaos will surely ensue unless passenger areas are at least DOUBLED in size and facilities. Perhaps the smooth spin-talking management should have to catch a flight from their own airport as ""ordinary passengers"" to experience just what their ""customers"" have to suffer. If this airport was a retail outlet it would have closed down years ago through its atrocious customer services and lack of management concern for those who pay their wages.

Luggage delivery and check in are both faster. Boarding announcements are often inaudible or unintelligible or both. The prices of the catering facilities in both terminals is a scandal about €3 for a small bottle of water.

However, the services, staff, lines, even the terminals themselves seem worn out and tired - exhausted from the constant fight-or-flight existence the airport lives under. I'll spare the details of my experience, only noting I was delayed, cancelled, and delayed again while just trying to pass through on a connector home. As I had extra time on my hands I decided to people-watch and experience the airport. People running from one place to another with frantic gazelle-like dodging and suitcases in tow. Others growing roots on burdened chairs while they wait with a hopeful stare at the stand-by list. Missed flights, pilots timing out, gate changes, and a maelstrom of reluctant airline refuges just looking for escape. Personnel were usually trying to be helpful, to their credit, but honestly inside I think they knew they were just plugging holes in the Titanic - praying to make it to the end of their shift. Problems if you need to get to the buses and shuttles. Down there, around the bend, back up an elevator? The midnight group of us were on a quest to find the final sign depicting 'Door 2.' The next day at 6.45am I returned with the hope times had improved but sure enough there were already the runners, the sitters, and the delayed flights all displaying the new day's same experiences for would-be travelers through O'hare.

The duty free seemed to house the only departure monitor in the whole airport. Worryingly our flight did not appear.

There were bottlenecks on the walk from the gate down to the shuttle trains which take people from the remote satellite terminals to the 'main' part of T5 which houses passport control/baggage reclaim as well as check-in/security on departure. Had to wait around 20 minutes to get on a train, because in many cases the shuttles would arrive from the previous stop (the C gates) already full. Was a bit stressful. At passport control, it was a 30-minute wait for non-EU nationals, expected as this was the morning rush. Immigration officer was courteous and polite (am a frequent visitor to the UK, so minimal questions asked). She endorsed (i.e. stamped) the wrong visa, and when I pointed out her error, she rectified her mistake with minimal fuss. Bags didn't take much time. Very convenient vending machines if you need to pick up a SIM card in the baggage claim hall-if not, there are several shops in the arrivals area selling UK SIM cards, plus WHSmith and a few other outlets. Signage to Heathrow Express clear, and in 20 minutes was in central London. Departure: Arrived on the HEX, and wanted to do VAT refund, but the office was on the other side of the terminal, and quite busy at that, so I ended up ditching-they should have a VAT refund office on either end of the large T5 check-in area. My flight left at 1pm, and there were quite a number of flights leaving, a mixture of European and intercontinental flights. Used self-service kiosks to print BPs, then waited for a good 30 minutes in the bag drop queue. Would be much more efficient to have a proper self check-in service, where passengers can print and stick their bag tags themselves. Although the queue to get into security was short, getting in line to go through the scanner, then waiting again for the bags to come out through the machine all ended up taking a good 15 minutes. By then, only had 70 minutes or so until departure. Bearing in mind that my flight left from Gate B35, which required another ride on the shuttle, only had 20-25 minutes to grab a bit and run. Despite arriving 3 hours in advance, with the all the walking and waiting, felt like I was cutting it close. Overall a mixed bag. I highly recommend anyone planning on doing a VAT refund to get there a good 4 hours before their flight (and of course, you need to be prepared to show them your purchases, so unless it's in your carry-on, you need to do this before checking in your bags).","Arrival and Departure","01-07-2015","Solo Leisure",7,2,5,5,4,4,4,NA,3,1

However it is not as crowded as it used to be not a long queue in front of security. Some annoying passengers questioned why they had to take off their accessories water etc but you encounter those kind of passengers everywhere in the world. After security there are plenty of shopping. Heathrow is probably the best place for airport shopping partly due to the exchange rate. Arrival was a good experience.

Also make sure you have baggage tabs on your hand luggage and you get a stamp once your bags are screened - if you do not have this you run the risk of missing your flight depending on the attitude of the staff at the gates (I saw a fellow passenger sent back to get this and she missed the flight to BKK to my knowledge).

Due to a late arrival our connection time was shortened to a little over an hour. We transferred easily from Terminal 5 to Terminal 3 although it takes about 15 minutes by bus to do so. However the security screening at Terminal 3 was completely unacceptable. First of all there were only 2 lines open. Secondly once it was our turn our bags were placed into a tub and then abandoned. Simply left on the belt and everyone walked away. I asked several times for someone to process us and was told someone was on their way. Several security personnel were simply standing around doing nothing. I then went to the supervisor's desk and demanded that someone process us. He told me to stop shouting at him and that he had dispatched someone. Again we waited. I explained again that we had a flight to catch. No one was interested in the least in this. Then an agent took our tub and moved it forward to a table. Then another agent came. All these agents moved at snail speed. It was like a bad movie. No one was friendly not to mention displayed any sense of urgency whatsoever. The agent then carried our tub very slowly to another desk and proceeded to review our bags. We had a pasta machine brand new unopened in the box. This then needed to be taken apart examined it might have been a weapon and only when yet another agent a supervisor and the only person with any sense in that whole bunch said that it was ok were we permitted to pack everything up and proceed. I was absolutely furious. We were on our way to Dallas and arriving in the US was a breath of fresh air everyone there was friendly we processed quickly. The staff in London should be ashamed.

It is particularly bad when one queue coming down the stairs has to merge with another queue entering at ground level.

The gift shop was closed and another coffee stand was also closed .When the coach arrived to take us to the plane people gathered round in a 'rugby scrum' pushing and shoving to get their boarding pass processed. Some old man ran from the back and just barged everybody out of the way the get on the coach first .There was no order and no queuing system .I have never seen anything like this in my life.

I was asked why I didn't have a boarding pass for the final leg of my journey which could not be issued in London because the airline could not issue it there. All very annoying.

Honestly, my 7-hour layover in the airport led me to think that Schiphol is not the airport as it may have been a decade ago. Holland Boulevard is under renovation (and doesn't look nice anymore), so are the museum and the library, extremely overcrowded at McDonald's and at a Starbucks, and there is no place other than at the gates where one can sit and recharge electronics (outlets are extremely limited and some don't even work), internet access is okay but slow and needs renewal every hour. Finally, the lounges are pretty much overcrowded. Schiphol looks like it had better days in the early 2000s and the early 90s. Probably my most memorable experience there was the voice ""mind your step"" at the end of every walkway. Unfortunately, this place is like falling apart for when Amsterdam had rain, parts of the airport ceiling were dripping water, this aging airport needs more than what the current renovation project is working on. And as always, too much traffic (travellers are from all parts of the world), since this airport is a major European hub, yet I doubt that the airport can tolerate this much.

Departure was not as good as you already have to pass through security just to enter the building. Check-in was ok and took a while even though we were already checked in online. Paying the exit tax was pretty straight forward and involved no queuing. Once pass immigration there are a few shops but the prices are not competitive if you compare it to other Asian airports in the region. The airport is old but I have seen worse.

Not the best impression for an international entry point for the USA. Do not even attempt to make a connecting flight with under 3 hours to spare. We had to queue 25 mins for an automatic passport check queued 20 minutes to see an immigration official then picked up luggage then queued again to someone to check our reason for visiting rechecked bags then had to clear security again (more queuing). On top of that the boarding cards from LHR didn't work so we were sent back to the American Airlines desk to be reissued new ones. Until we got to a gate staff were almost universally unhelpful (we were told by all that we had time to make our flight easily). American airlines blame the airport and take no responsibility for the systematic chaos and the airport staff apparently don't get any feedback that people are missing their flights because of the queuing. We missed our flight to SLC were put on standby for the next one late at night were booked onto one the following day in the end which was cancelled when we arrived at the airport the next morning. Not to mention last minute gate changes causing havoc and confusion for passengers. We did get to SLC in the end having been issued 5 separate lots of boarding cards.

There was a light evening rain but the walkways are not generally covered so by the time we got there we were a bit wet. The one bright spot was passport control was fast and the TSA was friendly. Now for the nightmare of the return trip. Immigration was nearly a 90 minute wait. My wife is a PR of the US and she and I was told to go into the US line. Once there the TSA officer was rude disrespectful to me and my wife and despite the TSA mission statement was completely unprofessional. We then collected our bags and waited for another 45 minutes to get out of customs and it would have been longer if we would have been selected to have our bags screened. Went to Terminal 6 which was a construction zone surprised they didn't issue us hard hats.

For a start it would be more adequate to describe it as a tale of two airports. Terminals 1-2-3 are within walking distance to one another. Terminal 1 is mostly used by low cost airlines and has the ambience and charm of a bus station. It is also used by non-Schengen flights except those operated by Iberia and other Oneworld airlines. The non-Schengen section of the Terminal 1 is a bit quieter and modern. There is only one overpriced eaterie queues for check in and security are long but overall it does its job. Terminal 2 is pretty similar but is used by Lufthansa Swiss and Star Alliance airlines. Occasionally however I have caught the odd Easyjet/Ryanair flight from there. Terminal 3 is more modern and airy definitely the best of the bunch with Skyteam airlines mostly using it. Terminal 4 is located about 4 kms from the main three terminals and it is connected by a frequent and free shuttle bus (I don't understand some passengers' complaints about connection from Terminal 1 to Terminal 4). It is used by Iberia and Oneworld airlines as well as those airlines that have a code-share agreement with Iberia. It is architecturally impressive and compared to the other terminals feels relatively uncrowded however there are three things that really bother me about it 1) long walks from one gate to another 2) the fact that now you find it impossible to transit from one area to another without having to pass through some Duty Free and 3) any eating place is almost twice as expensive than in the city. Despite its shortcomings one thing that sets Barajas apart from other airports in Europe and the US is the public transport which is excellent from all Terminals. I live in Madrid and moan about Barajas but when I travel via CDG or FRA (not to mention US airports) then I realise that it's not bad after all.",NA,NA,NA,7,4,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

I noticed that the toilets are more well-maintained. Taxi queue is also efficient. However on departure horrors! First the Customs Office was not manned at all (I arrived at 10am) so I was not able to have my VAT Refund validated. I couldn't wait any further after seeing the extensively long queues to passport control and subsequently to security check. I must have queued for almost an hour. Naturally since my refund forms were not validated I was not able to get my refund back (was told I have 60 days) to claim my refund (if and when I return to Bangkok during this time frame). After reading a lot of reviews re duty free prices I decided to skip shopping. Most restaurants are filled with customers so I was not able to grab a snack and decided to wait for the inflight meal served at almost 2:30pm. Overall Suvarnabhumi Airport is comparably better with other airports in Asia (except Changi HKIA and KLIA in that order). As I am a frequent visitor to Bangkok small improvements in this airport are appreciated and hope that they remain consistent.

The short stay car park is a disgrace. It's outrageously expensive, full of potholes, signage that's confusing and faded and there's an obstacle to exit where mopeds are parked next to signs warning not to park there. The security is a joke. Today I had to queue 15 minutes at 4.45am. How can that be justified? Staff are completely disillusioned, rude and generally unhelpful. There is barely any seating in the departure 'lounge' and limited food outlets selling dreadful food but don't worry, there's plenty of space for a huge duty free shop and a shellac nail bar. The toilets are dirty and in a poor state of repair. The newly renovated arrivals area which seems nearly complete has clearly been designed by someone who is blind. The final slap to all customers is the utilitarian railings that force you to walk the length of the 40 metre arrivals room and then back again to exit. This airport doesn't give two hoots about delivering a reasonable customer experience. I won't be coming back.

Then you're through the terminal where all the gates are close together there is not enough seating and the only refreshments available are from a coffee guy who sells soft drinks/coffee & crisps. Coming back to Saudi via Riyadh is even worse as you have to collect your baggage clear customs and then then drag it from International Arrivals to Domestic Departures to check it onto the plane.

Bag drop off consists of huge queues at peak times. Half the desks are empty and they prefer to have staff herding passengers around instead of checking them in. No other airport in the world finds it a normal process to have people working full time to pull people from the main queue for the closing flight queue as they know they will miss the flights. In T1 I used to just wait at the closing flight queue instead of waiting for nothing at the normal check in. Then generally if you are on a short haul you may have to walk to gates in T1 anyway. Once had our aircraft brought back to the ramp as they had departed minus 10 passengers due to delays in T2. Security has improved in timings in T2 and found that more organised now but watch out for Aer Lingus sharks monitoring the queue for oversized cabin baggage to send you downstairs again. Airside services are nice and if departing T2 terminal its a pleasant experience just painful to get there. Of course pre clearance for US flights is a great plus. For arrivals prepare to walk and if you arrive in business hours car hire consists of a mini bus to main yards 15 min away. So factor this in unless you go gold with the hire company.

Plus points: 1) I stayed at the Regal Airport Hotel connected to landside of the arrivals section. Very good hotel with good service and facilities and reasonably priced. 2) Transport links are sound with bus and taxi options. 3) The terminal itself had all the essential facilities and conveniences. Minus points: 1) All passenger conveyors - escalators and travelators - have bollards that prevent passengers from bring baggage. From a safety perspective this is understandable with escalators - there are always lifts nearby too - but less so with travelators. 2) I did not find HKIA to be the easiest to navigate to my gate - wayfinding itself was fine but there were a lot of directional changes walking and the need to go from Terminal 1 to T2 by train in order to get my flight from T1. 3) The satellite building where my flight was leaving from was not well set-up for food and retail - the main building was but suffered from very heavy queuing which I could not afford to wait in. General thoughts: My experience of arriving at HKIA is generally positive across the board save for the initial feeling of confusion at the sight of high-rising escalators crossing each other in an imposing arrivals area. My experience from check-in to boarding the aircraft isn't one I look back on favourably - at the risk of sounding lazy I felt that a lot of time was wasted on the walking required and the queuing in the main retail and food complex added to my frustrations. However staff were friendly helpful and the security process was excellent. Looking back the plus points far outweigh the minus points.",NA,NA,NA,8,5,4,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

Another person in a red uniform said many of the kiosks in this row were down. So why didn't the person directing me to use them know this? An utter fiasco. As I left to the real person passport check line, people in red were arguing among themselves as to which machines were working, which were not.  Went downstairs to baggage claim and another fiasco. Baggage carousels had signage showing all the arriving international flights, but no information as to which carousel to go for your flight's baggage. Master baggage carousel sign on the wall listed all the flights. Again no information as to which carousel to use. Over the PA system, a hard to hear voice gave out the information on where to go for your baggage. No information saying area was being upgraded, work in progress or under repair. Or is this just the daily standard for LAX? Went to my terminal gate for connecting flight. Saw a snack area offering small, thin sandwiches and drinks.  I guessed an overpriced $5-6 for one.  I about choked when I was told they sell for over $11 each. Funny how retail stores must have a price shown for every item while LAX hasn't got a clue. I have to give LAX credit for the connecting flight baggage handling drop-off as you leave the International area. Finally an efficient area with someone in charge who knows how to do their job.

So if you are one of the first folks on the bus - it's normal to wait 15-20 minutes for it to leave.

Generally I find the processing outbound good - but I do have Gold FF status so never queue for Economy. QF staff generally good. The Xpress service into Immigration is mostly not open and queues are long but the agents have generally been friendly and polite. Security screening tends to be ordered chaos but again mostly polite. Once inside you are basically at the mercy of retailers of over priced brands and so called duty free that in many instances is way above retail prices at the bigger chains. Seating is poorly distributed and caters mostly for consumers fast food so just finding somewhere to rest while waiting to board is pretty hit and miss. I do use the Qantas Business Class lounge which is usually not too crowded and definitely a bonus and worth it if you are prepared to fork out the fee for the Qantas Club; the priority boarding is also a huge bonus! Inbound I find usually OK even weaving through the Duty Free shop where at least the booze is significantly cheaper than retail. I use an ePassport now and haven't had a problem yet but even when using the agents didn't have a long wait. There's little point worrying even if it is slow because the baggage is going to be a longish time in arriving. Lifts to the various exit points outside Customs in the Arrivals Hall are far too small to handle more than about two luggage trolleys and far to few to move people at any reasonable speed or volume. Parking is obscenely expensive for anyone picking you up. My experiences in the past with the domestic terminal however are poor - unhelpful staff inefficient check-in even with the self check-in kiosks rude staff at the security screens.

Elderly people left to struggle with their bags up the stairs and then a long walk to meet the rude and slow passport control staff. After all this you would at least expect your luggage to be on the carousel (after negotiating more stairs back down!).

Queuing time for passport controls (especially for departures as arrivals seem to be much better) could be reduced and more facilities (restaurants bars shops) could be added to the departure hall (of both T1 and T2). Even smaller domestic airports like Chengdu or Hangzhou are better equipped from this point of view. The main problem however is the duty free area: bars/restaurants are expensive and of average quality shops are few and look all the same. An international airport should a better variety (see Shanghai Hongqiao Airport for example).

The departure area is dull and there is absolutely nothing to do here except sit and wait for your flight. OK there are a couple of coffee stands and a business lounge but they are pretty awful.

There are now more flights to the UK by the budget airlines Ryan AirWizzair and Central Wings (part of LOT Polish Airlines). Also BA are starting up daily flights from Gatwick to Poznan and return from the end of March 2008.Maybe one of the budget airlines might set up in competition to BA from Poznan to Gatwick to reduce the fares on that route but that maybe my wishful thinking! There is an an express bus from the Airport to Poznan main railway station-about 20 mins to half an hour depending on traffic. The taxis are also better regulated now and you have a right to ask for a receipt at the end of your journey so you are not overcharged. Into town is currently about 20 Zloty about 4 GBP and takes about 15 minutes again depending on traffic. The restaurant overlooking the runway (upstairs) has now had a makeover and is more cosy and warmly furnishedbut the staff are still very helpful and friendly and speak good English.

I like the departure hall it is spacious and the swing of the Airport has become very crowded during peak season resulting in lack of seats insufficient amount of restrooms and long queues everywhere. It is also very likely to get in serious trouble when you have a transfer from an incoming international to a domestic flight. Travelers are subject to redundant procedures like collecting your luggage from the carousel then going through customs and go through the check in procedure again in the departure hall in a long queue together with new and other transit passengers while you already have your boarding pass and your luggage is correctly labelled. Finally you have to go through security again. Like authorities usually act many years too late it seems there is now a decision to abandon these crazy procedures in 2015. In my case last year I had to wait a long time for my luggage then had to run to the departure hall and look for an understanding staff member to assist in bypassing the queue for check in. That way I was just in time to catch my connecting flight. This year I was not so lucky when the luggage handling system was down due to a thunderstorm for the rest of the day. I finally arrived in the departure hall with my luggage where thousands of people were waiting not knowing what to do. The announcements by the pubic address system were only an apology for the inconvenience which was of no use at all instead of giving a clear explanation about the workaround implemented. To give instructions for dropping the luggage for your departing flight the staff member who could yell most loudly was selected. Of course these messages were missed by many people. Finally I ended up for hours in a queue of hundreds of people in front of the service desk to get my missed flight rescheduled and was lucky to reach my destination the same day and got possession of my luggage 4 days later. Definitely an airport to avoid during peak season when you have a connection to make. Hopefully things get better in 2015.",NA,NA,NA,3,2,3,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

"mexico-city-airport","/airport-reviews/mexico-city-airport","Mexico City Airport customer review","N Taylor","Mexico","2011-05-04","I wouldn't normally write a review like this but after waiting almost two hours (standing up) for my in-laws a few days ago I wanted to share my renewed unhappiness with this airport. We would have been able to escape to the American Express lounge but unfortunately my hubby had forgotten his card. I am British but I live in Mexico City thus I have no choice but to grit my teeth and face this horrendous airport several times per year. I therefore also mainly travel through Terminal One. Terminal Two is a bit more pleasant in that it is newer but my review refers to T1. Departing from Mexico City is much better than arriving however it still leaves much to be desired. Taxis are good and inexpensive (make sure you pre-book to get a secure white/red taxi and never hail the green/white taxis or the red/gold taxis. The special sirport taxis are white and yellow and are also safe) and the airport is located in fairly close proximity to the city centre so in theory it should be fairly quck to arrive there. However with traffic in Mexico City it can take much much longer than expected so be aware of this to avoid missing flights. If you make your own way there by car strangely for a major airport it is not signposted until you are practically there so you need to be fairly sure of where you are going before you attempt this. It is also located in a fairly off putting and run down part of town so it is not the kind of place you want to get lost in. This also goes for leaving the airport. Parking can be difficult at peak times. Inside the airport - during the summer months the heat can be awful I am not sure if there is air conditioning or if it just doesn't function when needed. It can be tricky to get to where you want to go as Departures and Arrivals are very poorly signposted and the lay out is confusing. So far when I have checked in here I haven't had to wait too long as I always make a point of checking in online and getting there early and using the bag drop when I fly British Airways however we did face a bit of a queue flying with Iberia. I have not experienced too many going through security either so they have obviously organised outgoing flights a bit better than the incoming flights. Passing security facilities are fairly average. As other reviewers have said the terminal is fairly shabby and could do with a renovation but at the end of the day that would probably cause utter chaos. Some of the gates have absolutely no seating areas whatsoever so you basically just have to stand until you are able to board which can take a long time. Arriving in Mexico City - a completely different story and the main reason for the very low scores. Do not expect anything to happen quickly as several large European flights all arrive at almost exactly the same time every day (approx 7pm). Strangely after disembarking the plane arriving passengers are ushered through the arrivals lounge and all is a bit confusing. The queues at passport control are generally frightful and can take over an hour both in the line for nationals and non-nationals (after receiving conflicting information about which I should use as a holder of a Mexican Resident's Visa I have used both). Baggage claim is equally horrendous with several flights worth of baggage arriving on one carrousel whilst many others remain empty. Again there is limited airconditioning so it can be especially unpleasant in the warm summer months. After finally picking up your bags you then have to queue again to have all your luggage scanned (don't expect any help with this - I was travelling alone literally moving my life from London to Mexico City and had a significant amount of luggage as a result three members of staff simply watched while I struggled to load the cases onto the belt - same story when I took them out and put them back on the trolley) and they never open up all the scanners so again this can take a long time. After scanning your bags you then have to hit a button - green means go but if it comes up red you have to have your luggage inspected by an officer. This is also worth remembering when picking someone up do not rush to get there when the flight lands as it is a waste of time as they can take another two hours on top of that. Queues for taxis can be long especially if you need a larger vehicle and once in your car/taxi there is still Mexican rush hour traffic to contend with through a not-so-nice part of town.",NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Heaven forbid you're making a connection and your arrival and departure are from different wings or different terminals. Even if they're both Schengen (or non-Schengen as my recent trip was) you'll wind up going through security at least once. And of course if you don't like the food and shopping options in the arm of the terminal you're in your only option is to yes wade through a security checkpoint all over again! The problem is compounded by poor signage often courtesy of Lufthansa (could someone please instruct them that white lettering on a yellow background is not a readable choice). At one point I didn't even notice I had exited one security zone to enter another until I was almost past it (no sign saying ""Leaving secure zone"" only a ""no entry"" sign facing the other way!). When I asked the security officer who saw me there trying to see what the other side of the sign said he forced me to go through the security line all over again if I wanted to turn back! Of course this wouldn't be nearly as big of a problem if each section of each terminal had adequate food and shopping options but all but one of them most emphatically do not. International travelers going through a major hub expect more choices (without a trip through security) than just one sit-down restaurant one coffee shop one news stand and a duty-free! I won't even get started on the small infrequent and hard-to-find restrooms. That said if your destination/departure is Frankfurt the range of ground transport options hotels and car hire makes it quite convenient.

Compared to some others I was quite lucky to arrive at a time where the queues at passport control were limited.

Then the boarding room is small with not enough seats (as in most airports). Boarding by Bus. It was worth on the way back. For some reason Turkish Airlines site would not allow me to print my second (international) boarding card and time was short. There is a ""quick way"" from domestic to international but you need the boarding card! Luckily could find an automate that worked. Safety control was not too bad. But on the international side boarding rooms are much smaller than on domestic with a pitiful number of seats. Plane was delayed with very little information.

We therefore stayed overnight and travelled the next day. On our return flight it could not have been more different we arrived early afternoon and there were no queues at all we were through immigration in 5 mins. That was great but we will never transfer through an airport again unless we can overnight as you just don't know how long the Immigration Q will be not just in the USA but worldwide. Miami is an older airport in the BA and AA areas and reminded me of 1960's 'Thunderbirds' film settings. Real vintage stuff but it has all you need with regard to toilets and food. Passenger search was reasonably quick and no complaints there. It is confusing checking in with AA but if you memorise the airport layout on the website you get an idea of where to go to checkin which helped us find BA check-in.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

It must be the slowest airport in the world. I've been to India six times now so am well acquainted with the slowness of almost everything in the country. However one expects better of an airport especially one that's fairly new and modern-looking and no other Indian airport I've travelled flown home from has been as bad. The first queue was a long one but no longer than many other airport queues I've been in but unlike in most other airports it hardly moved the queue for immigration at Heathrow when I got home was just as long but constantly moving so didn't take too long. The Chennai queue was unbelievably slow. Then came the queues (plural) for security. I understand that they have good reason to take security seriously and I'm glad they do but they kept recalling bags to have another look at them and then someone would search them by hand. One young woman who was just in front of me had her handbag taken from her and put through three times and searched by hand twice - this really can only mean that the staff didn't do it correctly the first time unless it was the result of a malicious desire to make passengers miss their flights. My bag was put through the scanner twice and searched by hand. I saw this happening to other people too. This was on top of the body searches of course (which I know are necessary but do add more time to the process).

We had to disembark by air stairs and walk a long distance to the terminal building. Immigration took 10 mins and as we were only there for a long weekend we had no baggage. There was a large taxi rank which was a delight from our 30min wait at Edinburgh for a taxi last year. Flying out we got at the airport 3 hours before our 10.10 departure (easyjet to LGW).

Annoyingly they said go through customs (for UK and intercontinental flights separate departure area upstairs) 90 mins before departure and around 50 of us did. However a hazard was the escalator was kept running and we had to cram in to a small area for 25 mins before they opened up customs. We boarded 35 mins before (inbound was 40mins early) but there was a long walk down ramps (quite odd) our plane was at a stand the other side. It took a while to get down to the planes and a Ryanair was disembarking and pax had to walk across the ramp which caused a 10min hold up.

Those comments are absolutely true. This time I was vacationing in France so I figured that just arriving and departing from CDG could not be that bad right? Wrong. Arriving at Terminal 1 proved to be an absolute disaster. The facilities are operating at a multiple of their capacities with too few restrooms for example. The baggage area was clearly too small for even one or two arriving planes; people crowding around while waiting for their luggage created a jam where no one could get in or out or around. There was just not enough square footage for everyone and it is probably a dangerous situation. Even getting through the final customs check to embrace your loved ones was a crowded bottleneck involving a pushing/shoving battle just to somehow get through the maddening crowd. The parking and layout of the rest of the airport is confusing and illogical but we figured it out. Departing from Terminal 1 is even worse. Check in is okay but once you go through the first boarding pass check (ticketed passengers only) you take the escalator upstairs to see the real problem. You will stand in line for a minimum of one hour to get through the passport control. There were only two windows open for all departing passengers and those two officials took their time! I was up there two hours before my departure time and I nearly missed the plane. I have never just walked on a plane and had them shut the door but this is what happened. Everyone was in the same boat. The boarding announcements started while we were still in this non-moving line and everyone got very nervous. To run to the gate while they make the final boarding announcement and then realize you still need to go through security. It is all very unsettling. I would advise anyone who is using Terminal 1 to be upstairs three hours before your departure time.

My experience is as always with this airport variable. Most of the time it's good so I still recommend it. While the dreadful design of this terminal cannot be quickly improved I see no reason why they can't improve cleanliness or facilities. Flights are often delayed even at quiet times and the security experience is so variable that it's beyond a joke now. While I have always been well-treated by MAN's security it's the haphazard way the rules are applied which is so annoying. On my most recent flight half the queue went through a ""standard"" check while the other half were subjected to the full-body scanner a separate shoe scanner a full-body pat-down and a full head-to-toe hand-held scan. While several major airports around the world have now given up on such over-zealous screening I'm beginning to wonder just what MAN knows about security risks which the rest don't? Either everyone should be subject to such intensive scanning or no-one at all. This took much longer than the bag scan did - which meant that our bags were sitting unsupervised on an adjacent belt for quite a few minutes. Not impressed at all.",NA,NA,NA,2,4,1,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

It was badly damaged during the troubles. The only facilities were a partly destroyed hanger. Now the main terminal has been refurbished it is quite respectable. Arrival is easy enough. You will need to be firm with the baggage handlers. They have been clamped down on recently but they will still try there best to relieve you of a few $. If you let them one will carry your bags to the door another for a few more feet etc. Just say no and try not to look as if it is your first visit. Once you have got your bags you have to visit the customs bench. You will now need transport to Freetown which is the other side of a large estuary. There are helicopters a ferry and a hovercraft. Take the Paramount helicopter the other two take too long and are unreliable. It is cheap $37 on my recent visit. You may have to change this into the local Leones before buying the ticket. There is an exchange office which gives respectable rates. The helicopter departure area is the old hanger that used to be the main terminal. It is dirty and hot so try to get the first helicopter. These are old but reliable Russian MI-8's. You will arrive at the Mammy Yoko heliport. Here you will most likely be met by your local agency or whoever you are visiting. If not local taxis are available. A trip to most parts of Freetown should cost no more than Le10-20000. If you do not have accommodation booked go to the Cape Sierra Hotel or Bintumani Hotel which are very close. On the way back the helicopters leave about 6 hours before the time of departure. You then wait outside the Lungi terminal for an hour or more before suffering the long and bureaucratic check in procedure. This is typically African and can take an hour+.

It was like travelling in a developing country! Utter chaos. We arrived at the recommended two hours prior to departure only to find that we couldn't drop our bags as the flight wasn't yet open. The female staff were rude and clearly not well versed in customer service. Airport felt dirty especially the loos. As we were travelling with two young children we expected to be called to board the plane after speedy boarders but were not. A not very pleasant end to an amazing holiday on the island. Last impression of Santorini was not great thanks to the airport. Such a shame.",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

We arrived from South Africa to transfer to Edinburgh on Saturday 13th Dec and the late arriving A380 eventually parked at the far satellite - we then had to queue to board the very full transit train with everyone carrying luggage join the queue to follow ""Flight Connections"" queue to pass through passport control more escalators and walking brought us to yet another queue for security and on to the gate to queue yet again on those yellow footprints. Time to travel a few hundred yards = 70 minutes - and we caught our connection but our luggage did not. Terminal 5 seems to have been designed by the junior staff - it is not at well thought out why the complication of three separate buildings and the consequential underground railway? Terminal is such an unpleasant experience with absolutely no independent lounges and is so congested - pull it down and go back to the drawing board surely there are some competent architects who could make a much better job of it. Other large airports seem to manage it!",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0
"london-stansted-airport","/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport","London Stansted Airport customer review","V Brown","United Kingdom","2013-07-07","I have long been of the opinion that Stansted has no concept of customer care. The whole place seems vaguely grubby staff are frequently rude and security is a nightmare. However dropping off or picking up passengers was always fairly simple. To drop off you drove up to the terminal your passengers got out (under cover) you drove out. To pick up you drove to the pick-up zone your passengers got in you drove out. Not any more. The whole thing has become shambolic. This morning I drove my husband to Stansted with the objective of dropping him off at 5 am for a 6.30 am flight where he had already checked in online but we were allowing at least an hour for him to get through security (see earlier comment about security). Arrived at 5 am discovered you could no longer drive up to the terminal and then took another 10 minutes to get to the so-called drop-off area where we were confronted by vehicles in the parking areas on both sides and also in the central lane which explained why there was a traffic queue trying to get into the drop-off area in the first place. As there was absolutely no chance of parking properly my husband got out and then wended his way through the melee. Fortunately he had no luggage to impede him. If the drop-off zone was properly sign-posted perhaps the log jam in the first lane would not occur but at the same time you cannot blame people for wanting to be as close as possible to what is anyway the far end of the terminal building. This morning was dry and warm so not a problem but in inclement weather with luggage? I wonder whether the designers of this chaos have ever tried it out as paying customers. In my book Stansted has gone from mediocre to completely shambolic.",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0

Arriving from London the entire management of process was rude and amateurish with surly rude and obnoxious immigration people and no clear plan for dealing with queues other than ""let's hope for the best""! This is one airport in the US I will in future avoid as an international arrival point in the US - never again! It took hours to get through immigration and customs and then to make my way to another terminal for a connection to Honolulu. Having allowed over 3 hours I literally just made it!

"phuket-airport","/airport-reviews/phuket-airport","Phuket Airport customer review","Glenn Barnes","Hong Kong","2012-01-27","On arrival long lines for immigration in fairness it was Chinese New Year holidays so lots of extra passengers to deal with but still only 60% of the immigration booths occupied. Once through immigration its quick to exit as your bags are already available a bit of congestion caused by all the various taxi touts so finding your pre-booked transport takes a keen eye. On departure you have to put your bags through x-ray on entering the terminal. There are two so go for the furthest one as its less busy. Check-in as one may expect for a busy holiday airport busy but well organised. After security there are a variety of shops not to many dining options but good enough for an average wait. Duty free is very expensive though and seemed mostly to be Russian tourists who were buying - not many others.",NA,NA,NA,7,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

Coming into LAX in terminal two then another flight out from terminal 8 with the last flight leaving from terminal two. All times were a breeze. On arrival I was processed by a pleasant immigration officer and was kerbside within 45 minutes of landing. Terminal eight (United Express) a few days later was easy to navigate quick security reasonable selection of food outlets once past security. Flying internationally from terminal two on the last flight was a breeze. 10 minutes to process security and screening then onto a very good Air NZ lounge. Unlike others I experienced no surly or unhelpful staff - which to be honest is a surprise given past experience here.",NA,NA,NA,4,5,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

When you consider she had just flown in from Geneva one of the worlds most expensive cities where you can drop off passengers free of parking charges for 15 mins it shows just how over-priced and greedy a once user friendly and great alternative to London's big two airports has become.

I had to spend seven hours in transit area of the international terminal while going/coming back to/from Kathmandu. The international transit wait area has just hard bottom seats restrooms two little light snack stalls and two TVs - no duty free or lounges restaurants/cafes cyber stations sofas etc - all of these are available beyond security on the way to boarding flights which happens only 3 hours prior to the departure time. The transit wait area is a small area and authorities/airline land crew not very helpful - saw some airline crew make fun of a non-English speaking passenger which looks like is a frequent case here sadly.

Long walk with intermittent moving sidewalks to Passport Control. Finally got to a small room with four open stations and no working air conditioning. Next onto baggage pick-up and Customs. It seemed like we had entered the third world. The carousels were clumped together right next to the Customs lines going out of the hall. Both groups of people and their luggage morphed together into an unmoving mess. Minimal signage following yellow footprints to bag recheck where we came to another bottleneck with no organization.

Easy to pass time on return plenty of seats and a great view of takeoffs and landings. This time the flights arrived and left from the terminal side. Duty-free very expensive but you don't have to use it - it's an air terminal with a few shops not a ghastly mall like Heathrow or Sydney.
